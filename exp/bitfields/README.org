#+TITLE: Experiments with bit-fields

Conventional C/C++ compilers do not optimize bit-field access. For instance,
[[./bitfields.c][bitfields.c]] defines a C-struct with 1-bit bit-fields, and
attempts to acess them. An 1-bit field access always takes a shift and a bit
mask, even when a bit mask could suffice.
