Financial Hypotheses
====================

Financial results often rest on crucial assumptions about market elements.

Efficient Market Hypothesis
---------------------------

The efficient market hypothesis treats investors as omniscient, rational
beings. That is, information is available to all investors at the same time,
and every investor, preferring profit to loss, acts on all available
information.

The effect is that the market price reflects all relevant information about a
stock, and stocks are thus neither under- or overvalued.
