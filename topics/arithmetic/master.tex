Numerical analysis deals in ((multidimensional) arrays of) real numbers. The
set of real numbers, in general, is not susceptible to computational
representation\cite{turing-1936-7}. Since the inception of physical computers
we have thought ways to approximate real numbers using more representable
devices.
