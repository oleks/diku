Numerical analysis deals in ((multidimensional) arrays of) real numbers. The
set of real numbers, in general, is not susceptible to a computational
interpretation\cite{turing-1936-7-computability}. Since the inception of
physical computers we have thought ways to approximate real number arithmetic
using more representable devices: finite sets of discrete objects, with finite
functions in-between them.

This fundamental machinery can represent a range of more abstract computational
devices, such as, the lambda calculus.
