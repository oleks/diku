Numerical analysis deals in ((multidimensional) arrays of) real numbers. The
set of real numbers, in general, is not susceptible to computational
interpretation\cite{turing-1936-7-computability}. Since the inception of
physical computers we have thought ways to approximate real number arithmetic
using more representable devices. These devices are finite sets of discrete
objects and finite functions between these sets.

This fundamental machinery can represent a range of more abstract computational
devices, such as, the lambda calculus.
