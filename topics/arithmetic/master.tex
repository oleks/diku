Numerical analysis deals in ((multidimensional) arrays of) real numbers. The
set of real numbers, in general, is not susceptible to computational
representation\cite{1936-7-turing}. Since the inception of physical computers
we have thought ways to approximate real numbers using more representable
devices.
