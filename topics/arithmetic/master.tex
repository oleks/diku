Numerical analysis deals in ((multidimensional) arrays of) real numbers. The
set of real numbers, in general, is not susceptible to computational
interpretation\cite{turing-1936-7-computability}. Since the inception of
physical computers we have thought ways to approximate real number arithmetic
using more representable devices.

Computers on the other hand, are good at representing finite sets while
operating on them using finite functions.
